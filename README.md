## Introduction

In today's digital age, speech recognition technology has become an integral part of various applications, ranging from voice assistants to transcription services. This project showcases a simple implementation of speech recognition using the SpeechRecognition library in Python. The program captures audio input from the microphone, sends it to Google's speech recognition API, and converts it into text.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/).

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install SpeechRecognition
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` script using the following command:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. The program will start listening to your microphone input. Speak a sentence or phrase clearly into the microphone.

3. After you stop speaking, the program will process the audio and attempt to recognize the speech. The recognized text will be displayed on the console.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- SpeechRecognition library
