## Introduction

In today's digital age, speech recognition technology has become an integral part of various applications, ranging from voice assistants to transcription services. This project contributes to the larger goal of democratizing speech technology for regional languages, empowering non-English-speaking people, and making information more accessible to a broader audience. The program captures audio input from the microphone, sends it to Google's speech recognition API, and converts it into text.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Google Colab installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the official [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install SpeechRecognition
   ```

## Usage

To run the project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Download and extract the audio files from the dataset.
3. Open the "IAIML.ipynb" file in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the code cells in the notebook.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- SpeechRecognition library

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Bengali ASR training dataset: https://openslr.org/53/ . We used a portion of bengali audio files including conversations, idioms, and phrases.

## Contributors
The project was developed by a team of students from Symbiosis Institute of Technology, Pune
